## Otolith Microchemistry Analysis
<br>

### Pacific cod, Korean peninsula
<br>

**Project Description:** This directory contains all analysis completed on *preliminary* otolith microchemistry data from Pacific cod samples taken from spawning aggregates around the Korean peninsula. Multivariate analyses include: 
1. PERMANOVAs
2. Mantel tests
3. NMDS ordinations
4. Hierarchical cluster analysis
5. Kmeans cluster analysis
6. Cluster visualization: dendrograms, tanglegrams. 
<br>

<br>

**Directory Structure:**

`data`: data files used in analysis. Final, filtered files are: `PCod_Korea_Structure_assignment`, `PCod_Korea_Microchem_filtered`, `PCod_Korea_ExpData_filtered`
<br>
`graphics`: graphs, plots of raw data and multivariate analyses. 
<br>
`output`: R output from PERMANOVAs, ANOVAs, and Mantel tests, copied into text files. 
<br>
`scripts`: R scripts used for analyses
