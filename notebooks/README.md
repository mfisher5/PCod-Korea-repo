## Notebooks

This folder contains all of my Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks have notes detailing all stacks pipeline / post-stacks filtering steps, code used during these steps, and data visualization. 


### Contents

**Pcod Korea Raw Data**: code from downloading Lanes 3 and 4 raw data. Includes checksums and Illumina flocell summaries. Will be adding a link to FastQC summaries of raw data files. 

**Post-Stacks Filtering**: A summary of all of the post-stacks filtering steps completed by our lab. Includes the scripts that I created which allow these filterings steps to be run automatically from a single shell script. 

**Reference Genome**: Details steps for building a reference genome de novo for the second runthrough of the stacks pipeline. Was practiced using Lanes 1 and 2 samples. 

**Stacks batch 4 -1**: *in progress*. This is the first notebook of batch 4. This batch includes all samples from Lanes 1 - 4. 

**Stacks batch 4 - pipeline meristics**: *in progress*. This tracks loci counts and visualizes data throughout the batch 4 run of the stacks pipeline.
