    "1. Number of raw reads per sample, lane 5 samples only\n",
    "2. Number of raw reads per sample, all lanes by population\n",
    "3. Number of stacks / loci per sample (ustacks), lane 5 samples only\n",

    "Note that batch 7 is the first stacks pipeline run to include lane 5 samples. These samples were often looked at separately in the pipeline meristics because the lane contained size major groupings of samples (*not* by population):\n",

    "2. low quantity DNA samples that were combined across two different extractions\n",
    "3. Alaska sample reruns\n",
    "4. reruns of potentially contaminated samples\n",
    "5. new, regular samples\n",
