    "\n",
    "I downloaded the [Ne estimator v2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.12157/pdf) program from [here](http://www.molecularfisherieslaboratory.com.au/download-software/). Version 2 of the program can handle over 10,000 genetic markers, so is more suited to SNP data than v1.\n",

    "*[Ne Estimator v2] produces estimates of contemporary effective population size, using several different methods and a single input file...includes three single-sample estimators (updated versions of the linkage disequilibrium and heterozygote-excess methods, and a new method based on molecular coancestry), as well as the two-sample (moment-based temporal) method. New features include the following: (i) an improved method for accounting for missing data; (ii) options for screening out rare alleles; (iii) confidence intervals for all methods; (iv) the ability to analyse data sets with large numbers of genetic markers (10 000 or more); (v) options for batch processing large numbers of different data sets, which will facilitate cross-method comparisons using simulated data; and (vi) correction for temporal estimates when individuals sampled are not removed from the population (Plan I sampling). *\n",
